# ConTeXtTools

Very much so a *work in progress* at the moment. This has come out of my personal attempts to get ConTeXt to play nice with Sublime Text, and there's still a great deal of work that could (should?) be done to it.

For the moment it includes a simple builder, syntax highlighting, and one or two snippets.
