# ConTeXtTools

Very much so a *work in progress* at the moment. This has come out of my personal attempts to get ConTeXt to play nice with Sublime Text, and there's still a great deal of work that could (should?) be done to it.

For the moment all it includes is a very simple builder, and a syntax file to do syntax highlighting.
