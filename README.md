# ConTeXt plugin for Sublime Text 3

This plugin provides some basic support for working with [ConTeXt][contextgarden] files. It provides `sublime-syntax` files for ConTeXt (and MetaPost too), and a basic builder (needs improvement). More interestingly, it also adds completions for the various commands ConTeXt defines, as well as pop-ups that show the documentation for a given command on typing it out.
