## Pop-ups, Relative Imports

The way pop-ups are done behind-the-scenes has been greatly improved. One nice
consequence of this is that the different parts of the anatomy of a pop-up can
all be styled via CSS as you please.

We took out the `<\!DOCTYPE html>` from the mini-HTML, as it's not needed and on
some versions of Sublime Text can be harmful. Added one or two things to the
`.sublime-syntax`es, and took out code related to orphan settings.

Relative imports: instead of modifying `sys.path` to import our modules, we use
relative imports `from .foo import bar`.

Fix some typos.
