## Phantoms, Adaptive Colouring

Put in phantoms errors after running a build. The phantoms are styled by CSS, so
as to adapt to whatever colour scheme is in effect. Similarly, pop-ups have been
changed: they have more semantic information attached to them, which is now also
styled by CSS. Therefore they, too, can adapt to the current colour scheme.

In line with this, some settings have been made redundant and removed.
