# v0.4.0 (2017-07-26)

## Syntax checks, Bugfixes, Misc

We've taken advantage of the `mtxrun` script's ability to do a syntax check, and
integrated it into the builder. Also tweaked the visuals and implementation of
errors/warnings in the builder. The other main change is to
`ConTeXt.sublime-syntax`, in the handling of markup such as `{\em ...}`: we now
use a better approach to handle it, on the user-facing side of things nothing
much has changed though.

Some fixes, also update the README, and put back in a (partially working)
version of the argument analysis we had before.
