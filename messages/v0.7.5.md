# v0.7.5 (2018-06-09)

## Windows fixes, better default behaviour

- Overwrite local symbol list by default. Created `Default.sublime-keymap`, and
  put the local symbol list change into there. So now we use the combined
  overlay thing by default, with no effort required from the user. Also added a
  better behaviour when there are no entries in the symbol list.
- Better math syntax.
- Added install/update messages.
- Minimize dependencies.
  - `context` -> `mtxrun --script context`
  - `texlua` -> `luatex --luaonly`
- Windows specific fixes: add `shell=True` all over the place.
- Tweak handling of `pop_ups/try_generate_on_demand`, should fix issue with it
  being set to `False`.
- More consistent formatting of the builder output.
- Better default settings.
