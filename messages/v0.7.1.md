## Better Auto-Builder

We renamed some settings (and added some new ones) in order to make room for the
normal- and auto-builder to each have their own settings. Now you can, for
example, have the normal builder show the output panel all the time, and have
the auto-builder only show when there are errors.

The settings are organized under the prefixes `current.builder/normal` and
`current.builder/auto`.
