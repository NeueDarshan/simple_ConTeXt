# v0.7.2 (2018-05-02)

## Better Syntax & BibTeX Parser, More Options

Main changes:

- Syntax:
  - Fix word boundary issue (e.g. `\TEX82` works as expected).
  - Do not include TeX comments (in general) in verbatim.
  - Treat square brackets `[...]` as an argument to a verbatim environment if
    and only if it's on the same line as the `\start...` command.
- More pop-up style options. (Match and hang indentation can be toggled on the
  fly, whilst start/stop can be toggled at generate time only).
- More robust BibTeX parser.
- Combined overlay remembers scope choices (unless you tell it otherwise).
- Remove scope restrictions on snippets.
- Add buffers to the default local symbol list
- Add `file_links/on` option to turn file links on or off.
