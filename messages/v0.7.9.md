# v0.7.9 (2018-06-21)

## Phantom/Inline Errors

- Added new settings:
  - `current.builder/auto/output/show_errors`
  - `current.builder/auto/output/show_errors_inline`
  - `current.builder/normal/output/show_errors`
  - `current.builder/normal/output/show_errors_inline`
- The `..._inline` options are for showing phantom/inline errors. That is,
  suppose that they are set to true, and we build a ConTeXt file, and encounter
  some errors. Then the error text will be shown inline in the source file, at
  the location the error occured.
- The other options are for showing the details of the errors in the build
  output panel.
