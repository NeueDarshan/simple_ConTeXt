# v0.7.4 (2018-05-17)

## Math syntax, interface fix, citation options

Extended the math syntax some, keeping code ligatures in mind (especially as
ConTeXt can do math collapsing itself via `\setupmathematics[collapsing=...]`).
Added setting `current.citations/command_regex` to extend the citation
auto-complete stuff. Added some indenting rules. Improved the interface parser,
including a bug fix with `<cd:string/>` and providing a (hopefully sensible)
fallback in case of unknown arguments.
